## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
people <- read_csv('http://datatrain.global/data/survey.csv')
people
p1 <- ggplot(data = people) + geom_bar(aes(x = gender, y= ..prop.., group = 1), stat = "count")
p1
p2 <- ggplot(data = people) + geom_bar(aes(x = favorite_animal, y= ..prop.., group = 1), stat = "count")
p2
p3 <- ggplot(data = people) + geom_bar(aes(x = weapon, y= ..prop.., group = 1), stat = "count")
p3
```
