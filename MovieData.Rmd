```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
movies <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericmkeen/capstone/master/movies.csv')
```

3. Is there a correlation between online film ratings and runtime? 

No.


```{r}
ggplot(data = movies, aes(y = rating_imdb, x = runtime)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, width = 0) + 
  geom_smooth()


ggplot(data = movies, aes(y = rating_meta, x = runtime)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, width = 0) + 
  geom_smooth()
```
